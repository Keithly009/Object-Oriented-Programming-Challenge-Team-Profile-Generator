# Work Team Profile Generator

## Your Task

In this project we are using tests and constructors to link them to the lib files in order to ensure that it is all properly coded. Each of the classes will be called through the "Employee.js" file whenever I would use the inquirer prompt (which will be used to ask the user a variety of questions that is relevant for each of the employee positions.

## User Story

```md
AS A manager
I WANT to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info
SO THAT I have quick access to their emails and GitHub profiles
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
WHEN I am prompted for my team members and their information
THEN an HTML file is generated that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on user input
WHEN I click on an email address in the HTML
THEN my default email program opens and populates the TO field of the email with the address
WHEN I click on the GitHub username
THEN that GitHub profile opens in a new tab
WHEN I start the application
THEN I am prompted to enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number
WHEN I enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number
THEN I am presented with a menu with the option to add an engineer or an intern or to finish building my team
WHEN I select the engineer option
THEN I am prompted to enter the engineer’s name, ID, email, and GitHub username, and I am taken back to the menu
WHEN I select the intern option
THEN I am prompted to enter the intern’s name, ID, email, and school, and I am taken back to the menu
WHEN I decide to finish building my team
THEN I exit the application, and the HTML is generated
```

## Mock-Up

The following image shows a mock-up of the generated HTML’s appearance and functionality:

The styling in the image is just an example, so feel free to add your own.

## Getting Started

This Challenge will combine many of the skills we've covered so far. In addition to the User Story and Acceptance Criteria, we’ve provided some guidelines to help get started.

Because this Challenge will require a video submission, refer to the [Fullstack Blog Video Submission Guide](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/computer-literacy/video-submission-guide) for additional guidance on creating a video.

Your application should use [Jest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest) for running the unit tests and [Inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer/v/8.2.4) for collecting input from the user. The application will be invoked by using the following command:

```bash
node index.js
```

It is recommended that you start with a directory structure that looks like the following example:

```md
.
├── __tests__/             //jest tests
│   ├── Employee.test.js
│   ├── Engineer.test.js
│   ├── Intern.test.js
│   └── Manager.test.js
├── dist/                  // rendered output (HTML) and CSS style sheet      
├── lib/                   // classes
├── src/                   // template helper code 
├── .gitignore             // indicates which folders and files Git should ignore
├── index.js               // runs the application
└── package.json           
```

**Important**: Make sure that you remove `dist` from the `.gitignore` file so that Git will track this folder and include it when you push up to your application's repository.

The application must include `Employee`, `Manager`, `Engineer`, and `Intern` classes. The tests for these classes (in the `_tests_` directory) must ALL pass.

The first class is an `Employee` parent class with the following properties and methods:

* `name`

* `id`

* `email`

* `getName()`

* `getId()`

* `getEmail()`

* `getRole()`&mdash;returns `'Employee'`

The other three classes will extend `Employee`.

In addition to `Employee`'s properties and methods, `Manager` will also have the following:

* `officeNumber`

* `getRole()`&mdash;overridden to return `'Manager'`

In addition to `Employee`'s properties and methods, `Engineer` will also have the following:

* `github`&mdash;GitHub username

* `getGithub()`

* `getRole()`&mdash;overridden to return `'Engineer'`

In addition to `Employee`'s properties and methods, `Intern` will also have the following:

* `school`

* `getSchool()`

* `getRole()`&mdash;overridden to return `'Intern'`

Finally, although it’s not a requirement, consider adding validation to ensure that user input is in the proper format.

## Grading Requirements

> **Note**: If a Challenge assignment submission is marked as “0”, it is considered incomplete and will not count towards your graduation requirements. Examples of incomplete submissions include the following:
>
> * A repository that has no code
>
> * A repository that includes a unique name but nothing else
>
> * A repository that includes only a README file but nothing else
>
> * A repository that only includes starter code

This Challenge is graded based on the following criteria:

### Deliverables: 15%

* A sample HTML file generated using the application must be submitted.

* Your GitHub repository containing your application code.

### Walkthrough Video: 32%

* A walkthrough video that demonstrates the functionality of the Team Profile Generator and passing tests must be submitted, and a link to the video should be included in your README file.

* The walkthrough video must show all four tests passing from the command line.

* The walkthrough video must demonstrate how a user would invoke the application from the command line.

* The walkthrough video must demonstrate how a user would enter responses to all of the prompts in the application.

* The walkthrough video must demonstrate a generated HTML file that matches the user input.

### Technical Acceptance Criteria: 40%

* Satisfies all of the preceding acceptance criteria plus the following:

  * Uses the [Inquirer package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer/v/8.2.4).

  * Uses the [Jest package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest) for a suite of unit tests.

  * The application must have `Employee`, `Manager`, `Engineer`, and `Intern` classes.

### Repository Quality: 13%

* Repository has a unique name.

* Repository follows best practices for file structure and naming conventions.

* Repository follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.

* Repository contains multiple descriptive commit messages.

* Repository contains a high-quality readme with description and a link to a walkthrough video.

## Review

You are required to submit the following for review:

* A walkthrough video that demonstrates the functionality of the application and passing tests.

* A sample HTML file generated using your application.

* The URL of the GitHub repository, with a unique name and a readme describing the project.
